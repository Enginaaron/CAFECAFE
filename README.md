How would you pitch your game in one line?
"Picture a cooking game that meets a wave-based survival game, except with a monstrous twist; serve both human and monster customers in a chaotic kitchen with or without a friend.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
Increasing difficulty with progressive waves of customers.
Upgradeable kitchen and chef abilities.
Special waves featuring monster customers with unique needs.
Boss battle waves every set number of rounds.
Single-player or couch co-op survival mode.
Versus mode where two players compete to outlast each other.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
Survival Mode:
Players cook in a fast-paced kitchen, preparing food to serve increasingly impatient customers.
Customers generate income when satisfied; unsatisfied human customers cause the player to lose a life.
After every five waves, a night shift begins, introducing monster customers who have stricter patience levels but do not cost lives.
Unsatisfied monsters damage the restaurant, requiring money to repair.
Every 15 waves, a boss monster appears with a complex order sequence; failure results in losing a life, but success grants a high payout.
The game continues until all lives are lost.

Versus Mode:
Two players compete in an endless mode, each assigned color-coordinated customers.
The first player to lose a life loses the game.
Customers progressively become more impatient, increasing the challenge over time.
